##  AKAII String Encoding

### A highly dubious Obj-C library for working with AKAII encoded strings

#### What is AKAII
Why, t'is an early 90's (late 80's?) string encoding used in S series AKAI samplers of course.

### Should I ever use this library?
No, not really. Swizzles and categories abound, though the `CHAR_TABLE` constant in the category
header may be of use to someone someday.
